# StockTracker
In this project, I implement an app that allows you to track your stock. I choose Persistence with Room to persist 5 features of a stock (Stock Code, Bought Price, Current Price, Amount, and Comment). This is an RecyclerView that implements CardView and each CardView displays all five features. On the ActionBar Menu, I have 3 items that navigate to different fragment. The info button will lead you to the information fragment where it shows you the App icon, App name with copyright mark, and version name. All are retrieved through code. The Web icon will lead you to the Web fragment where the initial URL is a stock site, but you can go where ever you want. The Setting button will lead you to the setting fragment where you have plenty of options all of which is stored by SharedPreference. You can turn on or off the alert when add or delete item. You can also turn on a SPECIAL FEATURE which is auto comment where it tells you if you gain or loss by how much.
